  #compute the log likelihood of data given the distribution
  #
  #Args:
  #distribution: type of distribution of the data. for example (binomial, poisson). Support for 2 as of now.
  #column: the column is a vector of numeric data over which we perform the maximum likelihood
  #Return: the log likelihood of the data.For example, mean for poisson, probability for binomial
